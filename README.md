This project is a modern Pokédex web application built using Next.js 13, featuring a hybrid routing approach with both the app and pages directories. It leverages TypeScript for type safety, SCSS for styling, and the PokéAPI to fetch and display data about Pokémon.
## Key Features:
- Pokémon Listing: Presents a paginated list of Pokémon with their images and names.
- Detailed Views: Provides detailed information for each Pokémon, including types, abilities, stats, and more.
- Image Optimization: Utilizes Next.js's Image component for efficient image loading and performance.
- Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile.
- Customizable: Easily extendable with additional features and Pokémon details.
- Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for API requests and invalid routes.

## Tech Stack:
- Next.js 13: Modern React framework for building full-stack web applications.
- TypeScript: Strongly typed language for improved code quality and maintainability.
- SCSS: CSS preprocessor for enhanced styling with variables, nesting, and more.
- PokéAPI: The official RESTful API for Pokémon data.
- Other: You can mention additional libraries you used for styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS), state management, etc.
